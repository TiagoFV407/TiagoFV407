- 👋 Hi, I’m @TiagoFV407
- 👀 I'm interested in working with programming, both Web, Mobile, Games, among others. I'm just a young man who wants to enter this field and learn as much as possible about what it means to be a real programmer. I think a lot about the Games area because I'm passionate about it, I understand that loving playing is different from programming and making games, but I still intend to enter this world.
